# Freedesktop notifications binds for python-sdbus

Supports both asyncio and blocking 

Implemented:

* NotificationsInterface - notifications interface to implement your own notifications daemon.
* FreedesktopNotifications - notifications interface proxy connected to 'org.freedesktop.Notifications' and '/org/freedesktop/Notifications'

This is the sub-project of [python-sdbus](https://github.com/igo95862/python-sdbus).
